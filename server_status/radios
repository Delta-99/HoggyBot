,"NOTE: PLAYERS SHOULD CHECK IN ON THIS FREQUENCY AS SOON AS RADIOS HAVE POWER AVAILABLE. Use this freq for all ATC communications. If a human controller is not on station, continue to use this frequency and call out important information, such as starting to taxi, holding short of a runway, lined up and/or taking off on a runway, inbound, downwind/base/final calls when landing (if able), when clear of a runway, and any other information needed to prevent any aircraft collisions.",,,,,

,"NOTE: THIS FREQUENCY IS THE PRIMARY MISSION FREQUENCY! All players will check in on this frequency after taking off from a runway or when going RTB. When a human controller is on station, they will provide tasking, flight coordination, and threat warning information for all aircraft monitoring this frequency. CAP aircraft will check in on this frequency first, then utilize interflight AND the CAP freq in lieu of Common when a human controller is on station, OR Common and the AI AWACS frequency when no human controller is present.",,,,,

,"NOTE: this frequency will be used by all aircraft performing CAP when NO human controller is on station. CAP aircraft will utilize this frequency to contact the AWACS AI and request intercept information, and will also utilize this frequency for all CAP interflight calls until a human controller comes on station.",,,,,

,"NOTE: this frequency will be used by aircraft performing CAP when a human controller is on station. CAP aircraft will use this frequency to request bogey dopes and any other GCI information required to defeat hostile aircraft, and human controllers will provide bogey dopes and GCI information, as well as flight coordination and threat warning information for all CAP aircraft. This frequency will NOT be used for CAP interflight when a human controller is on station.",,,,,

,"NOTE: this frequency is for use by Strike and SEAD aircraft for ground target tasking in order to avoid clutter on Common. All Strike and SEAD aircraft will monitor Common if enough radios are available. If not, they will check in on Common BEFORE switching to this frequency.",,,,,

HAWG and CHEVY aircraft should have enough radios to utilize their freq, Common, and the Strike freq simultaneously.
